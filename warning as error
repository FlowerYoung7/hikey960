log:cc1: some warnings being treated as errors
LD built_in.o error
need_SSR,get_node_info等声明在f2fs.h中的文件，找不到函数定义，报错。

尝试1：
Makfile中删除一行
KBUILD_CFLAGS   := -Wall -Wundef -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs \
           -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fshort-wchar \
           -Wno-format-security \
           -std=gnu89
           #add
           #-Werror-implicit-function-declaration \
           -Wno-format-security \
           -std=gnu89


尝试2：忽略错误
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11561261/how-to-compile-without-warnings-being-treated-as-errors
If you are compiling linux kernel. For example, if you want to disable the warning that is "unused-but-set-variable" been treated as error. You can add a statement:

KBUILD_CFLAGS += $(call cc-option,-Wno-error=unused-but-set-variable,)


尝试3：改变perf

Thanks for the update.

For future reference: if you are trying to build old versions of
perf (such as v4.14) with a very new compiler you can add WERROR=0 to
prevent any newly introduced warnings from causing the build to fail.

(cd tools/perf; make WERROR=0)
